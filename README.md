# Taxes calculator C++ RESICO

This is a related project with two other repositories that I have in my account.
- My UI in python  https://github.com/VALO64/GUI-RESICO-Calculator
- The hello world template using wxWidgets https://github.com/VALO64/wxWidgets_basic_template
You can access to the information to understand more about the project.

## Why didn't I continue with python?

Well this is just a personal decision, in the beginning I decided to practice my UI coding skills with python but I felt frustrated with the library of Qt even that's a high level language. My first coding language was C, so I tried to implement something cross platform, something that I could build and works in any machine also I wanted to comeback to my origins, for that reason I decided to use C++ and wxWidgets library for my project, in a weird way I understand C better than other languages so I just decided to read the documentation and update my progress.
